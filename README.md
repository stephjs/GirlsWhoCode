# Girls Who Code Curriculum :sparkling_heart::dancers::cherry_blossom::nail_care::information_desk_person::ribbon::crown:
I volunteer with GWC once a week. Here are lessons I've created to teach the kids the web development skills they will need to build their own projects. Feel free to use and modify

## About GWC
Tech jobs are among the fastest growing in the country, yet girls are being left behind. While interest in computer science ebbs over time, the biggest drop off happens between the ages of 13-17. [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) volunteers teach middle and high school girls a project-based coding curriculum while providing a supportive sisterhood of peers and role models to sustain their interest in computer science.
